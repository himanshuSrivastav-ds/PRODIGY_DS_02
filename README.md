# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns and trends, and uncover insights into the factors influencing passenger survival on the Titanic.

# Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912. The dataset includes variables such as passenger age, gender, class, fare, and survival status, among others. You can find the dataset on Kaggle's Titanic page.

# Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values:

Identified missing values in key columns and employed techniques such as imputation and removal to address them.
Focused on variables like Age, Cabin, and Embarked to ensure data completeness.
Outlier Detection:

Detected and addressed outliers in continuous variables such as Fare and Age to prevent skewed analysis.
Data Formatting:

Standardized data formats for consistency, including converting categorical variables into numerical format where necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:

Computed summary statistics to gain an initial understanding of the dataset's characteristics.
Variable Relationships:

Explored relationships between key variables, such as:
Survival Rate by Gender: Analyzed the impact of gender on survival rates.
Class vs. Survival: Examined survival rates across different passenger classes.
Age Distribution: Investigated the age distribution of passengers and its correlation with survival.
Visualization:

Utilized various data visualization techniques to reveal patterns and insights, including:
Histograms: Displayed age distribution to highlight central tendencies and variations.
Bar Charts: Illustrated the distribution of categorical variables like gender and class.
Heatmaps: Used to visualize correlations between variables, offering a quick overview of relationships.
# Tools & Libraries
Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: Used for data cleaning and processing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed for creating detailed and insightful visualizations.
NumPy: Assisted in numerical operations and handling missing data.
# Key Insights
Gender Impact:

Females had a higher survival rate compared to males, suggesting the impact of the "women and children first" policy.
Class Influence:

Passengers in first-class had a significantly higher survival rate than those in lower classes, indicating the influence of socio-economic status.
Age Factor:

Younger passengers had a better chance of survival, highlighting the potential impact of age on evacuation priorities.
# Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of the data cleaning process and the importance of EDA in uncovering hidden patterns within a dataset. By systematically cleaning the data and analyzing it through visualization, we can draw meaningful insights that help inform data-driven decision-making.
